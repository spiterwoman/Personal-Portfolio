# Pink Chrome Kawaii Portfolio — Starter

A zero-build starter you can open directly in VS Code and the browser. No React required.

## Run
1. Download the folder or ZIP.
2. Open `index.html` in VS Code.
3. Use the VS Code extension **Live Server** to run (or simply double click the file).

## Customize
- Edit colors in `:root` of `styles.css`.
- Replace the three tags (triangle/oval/rect) with your own shapes or images.
- Each tag is an `<a>` with `href="#section"`. Clicking scrolls and flashes the target card.
- The hover tilt uses pointer position + `transform: rotateX/Y` + translate parallax per tag.

## Ship
This is plain HTML/CSS/JS → drag the folder to Netlify/Vercel (static), or host anywhere.
